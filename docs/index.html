        The Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source project that helps <a class="page-link" href="/opa/docs/intro.html">policy enable</a> your
        application. By integrating with OPA, your application's operators will be empowered to
        manage the size, complexity, and scale of modern deployments.

                    <p>
                        OPA features a purpose-built declarative language for describing the expected
                        state of your application. Policies written in <a class="page-link" href="/opa/docs/lang.html">Rego</a> are readily understood
                        and easy to maintain.

                    <h3>Zero Dependencies</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are zero deployment dependencies in OPA. Furthermore, OPA is designed
                        around the fate-sharing philosophy for highly available systems.

                    <p>
                        OPA exposes RESTful APIs for managing policy modules and state relevant to policy
                        enforcement. The APIs produce and consume JSON data and are accessed via HTTP.

                    <h3>Low Latency</h3>
                    <p>
                        OPA's policy engine is designed from scratch with latency sensitive applications in mind.
                        OPA introduces as little latency as possible while still decoupling policy definitions
                        from application business logic.

                    <p>
                        OPA features an interactive shell that you can use to quickly experiment with
                        queries and data sets.

                    <h3>Embeddable</h3>
                    <p>
                        OPA is written in Go with the intention of being embeddable. Applications written
                        in Go can use OPA as a library if needed.
